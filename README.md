# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**Problem Statement:** This dataset contains data about direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. This data contains customer's personal information such as age, education, job, marital status, took loan or not etc. We seek to predict next marketing campaign stratigies from the last marketing campaign of the bank. The prediction column contains whether the customer is subscribed to a term deposit or not.

**Solution:** The aim of this project is to use the banking dataset for two different approach and then compare and analyze the best result between these two approach.
In the first approach the optimization was based on using hyperdrive for hyper parameter tuning for Scikit-learn Logistic Regression. Here I got an accuracy of 0.90895.
In the second approach I used AutoML. The best model selected by AutoML was VotingEnsemble with an accuracy of 0.91697 making it the best approach here.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Pipeline architecture:** 
including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
